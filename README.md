The travel planning system prevailing in Sri Lanka used to record the customer’s visiting areas, requirements and other specifications in a manual data entry system. When companies become more widened, it becomes more difficult to stick to the old system of recording used in the early centuries. Hence, an online web-based application of recording the customer’s to-do list and receipts is required by travel agencies to automate their systems. A stable and reliable system in travel planning is the key point to customer satisfaction. vTour mobile application is developing to meet the requirements.
